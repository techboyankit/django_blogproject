Hello reader !

* It is a blogpost made by me using Python,Django,Html and
  CSS, for creating personal blogs with legit user access.

* Here I have been using the following techniques :-

-  Using Django as a Python Web Framework for backend development.
-  Using HTML and CSS for front-end styling.
-  Separately created 'templates' and 'static' directory for 
   remotely storing static and ready_to_use html and css files.
   
* I have used Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code as required
  tools and platforms for coding respectively.
