Hello reader !

* It is a blogpost made by me using Python,Django,Html and
  CSS, for creating personal blogs for legit user access.

* Here I have been using the following techniques :-

-  Using Django as a Python Web Framework for backend development.
-  Using HTML and CSS for front-end styling.
-  Separately created 'templates' and 'static' directory for 
    remotely storing static and ready-to-use html and css files.
   
* I have used Visual Studio Code as required Python IDE for 
  coding respectively.
